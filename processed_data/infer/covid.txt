 singapore to allow differentiated covid-19 safety rules for travellers vaccinated overseas
<<p>>
 singapore
singapore: singapore will soon allow travellers fully vaccinated overseas to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated safety measures, the ministry of health (moh) announced on thursday (aug 19).
the announcement on thursday will be applicable to travellers including singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visit pass holders from all countries and regions.
from 11.59pm on friday, the immigration and checkpoints authority (ica) will issue "tamper-proof" vaccination stickers to newly arrived travellers who have been fully inoculated with a vaccine under the world health organization’s (who) emergency use list.
these stickers will be affixed to the passports of the travellers.
fully vaccinated covid-19 patients who have mild or no symptoms will also be able to recover at home from aug 30, as part of a pilot scheme by the health ministry.
the covid-19 cases will spend the "first few days" in a medical facility, before moving to home isolation.

singapore has adopted a vaccination-differentiated approach as it gradually reopens the economy.
among other measures, individuals who are fully vaccinated are currently able to dine-in in groups of five at f&b outlets.
to continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.
these travellers will be eligible for vaccination-differentiated safe management measures if they produce their passport with the valid tamper-proof stickers, moh said in its press release.
currently, only singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with vaccination records in singapore’s national immunisation registry are eligible for the differentiated safety rules.
all other incoming travellers have to obtain a negative pre-event test by a moh-approved test provider that is valid for 24 hours.
 this service is not intended for persons residing in the e.u.

to obtain this sticker, travellers must produce an english-language vaccination certificate to ica officers at immigration checkpoints when they arrive in singapore.
the patients and their household members must be fully vaccinated and must not belong to any vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or immunocompromised.

in its press release, moh added that it systems will be enhanced by september so that travellers, upon verification of their eligible vaccination status at entry, will also be recognised by safeentry (business) app through their tracetogether tokens or mobile apps.

vaccines under the who's emergency use list include pfizer-biontech/comirnaty, moderna, astrazeneca, sinovac-coronavac and sinopharm.
we know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with cna to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.
authorities on thursday also announced the launch of the country’s first vaccinated travel lanes with germany and brunei darussalam.
under the vaccinated travel lanes, fully vaccinated travellers departing from germany or brunei can enter singapore without serving a stay-home notice.

on 4 may 2021, the mtf announced additional community measures to keep the community safe and break the chains of transmission.

these are additional measures to what was announced on 30 april 2021.

these measures will strengthen the tt and se programmes, which are critical digital tools to facilitate contact tracing and bring down community spread.
by maximising tt coverage and active tt usage, this can facilitate quick detection and ringfencing of local cases and their close contacts, and minimise further spread to the community.
social gatherings and interactions
museums and public libraries
the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) has been closely monitoring the local and global covid-19 situation.
in view of the emergence of new virus variants as well as the increase in the number of locally transmitted covid-19 cases and unlinked community cases, safe management measures will be tightened to reduce the risk of community spread in this period of heightened alert.
outdoor exercise facilities and classes
the implementation of tt-only se will now be brought forward to 17 may 2021.
from 17 may 2021, scanning of se-qr codes with the phone camera and singpass app will be discontinued.
to ease the transition, id check-ins will be retained until 31 may 2021.
the full list of tt-only se venues can be found on safeentry website.
safeentry gateway required to be deployed at more venues from 15 june 2021
it was previously announced that tt-only se was slated to be implemented from 1 june 2021 across all venues that experience a higher throughput of visitors and/or where persons are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods.
the recent cases show that all of us must continue to be vigilant and observe all safe management measures.
vaccination sites will continue to remain open during this period subject to safe management measures and all are encouraged to continue to be vaccinated when it is offered to you.
