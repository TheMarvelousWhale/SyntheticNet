pfizer vaccine gives 95 per cent protection: study
<<p>>
between seven and 14 days after the first dose, protection against infection was found to be 57.7 per cent and protection against death 77 per cent.
"this is why it is important that people get both doses."
the team behind the research were not able to study the effect of the south african variant.
the study found two doses conveyed 95.3 per cent protection against infection and 96.7 protection against death seven days after the second dose.
by the start of last month, nearly five million people in israel had received two doses of the pfizer-biontech jab, more than 70 per cent of the population.
an analysis of public health data from israel - one of the countries with the highest proportion of fully inoculated adults - showed the vaccine was extremely effective in protecting even elderly individuals at a time when the more infectious british variant was dominant, according to results published in the lancet medical journal.
the authors said that one dose may provide a shorter window of protection, especially in an environment where new viral variants emerge.
"importantly, the study shows that two doses of the vaccine significantly increase levels of immunity and protection," said professor of molecular virology at the university of nottingham jonathan ball, who was part of the research.
but the protection was much lower when people received just a single vaccine dose.
after 14 days, that protection increased to 96.5 per cent and 98 per cent, respectively.
the independent experts on the who's strategic advisory group of experts reviewed sinovac's coronavac jab from phase three clinical trials in china, brazil, indonesia, turkey and chile.
authors of the research from israel's national vaccination campaign said it showed real-world proof that the pandemic could be ended by rapid, global vaccination programmes.
although it was "very confident" that two doses of the vaccine are effective in preventing disease, it cited evidence gaps in safety in pregnancy, and on safety and clinical protection in older adults, those with underlying disease and evaluation of rare adverse events detected through post-authorisation safety monitoring.

paris: the largest real-world study yet of the pfizer-biontech vaccine yesterday confirmed that it provided more than 95 per cent protection against covid-19 but found the level dropped significantly when people received just one of the two prescribed doses.

during the analysis period, there were 232,268 covid-19 infections, and nearly 95 per cent of samples tested were found to be the british b117 variant.
there were 4,481 severe infections and 1,113 deaths.
meanwhile, the covid-19 vaccine produced by china's sinovac biotech is effective in preventing covid-19 in adults under 60, but some quality data on the risk of serious adverse effects is lacking, world health organisation (who) experts have found.

 in south africa, where the b.1.351 lineage is prevalent and 800 participants were enrolled, nine cases of covid-19 were observed, all in the placebo group, indicating vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% ci, [53.5, 100.0]).
in an exploratory analysis, the nine strains were sequenced and six of the nine were confirmed to be of the b.1.351 lineage.
these data support previous results from immunogenicity studies demonstrating that bnt162b2 induced a robust neutralizing antibody response to the b1.351 variant, and although lower than to the wild-type strain, it does not appear to affect the high observed efficacy against this variant.i
 for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see biontech’s annual report as form 20-f for the year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on march 30, 2021, which is available on the sec’s website at www.sec.gov.

all authors have completed and submitted the international committee of medical journal editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.
no potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.
on december 12, 2020, after an explicit, evidence-based review of all available data, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued an interim recommendation for use of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥16 years for the prevention of covid-19.
before vaccination, the eua fact sheet should be provided to recipients and caregivers.
providers should counsel pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine recipients about expected systemic and local reactogenicity.

on december 11, 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 (bnt162b2) vaccine (pfizer, inc; philadelphia, pennsylvania), a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mrna vaccine encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) (1).
vaccination with the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine consists of 2 doses (30 μg, 0.3 ml each) administered intramuscularly, 3 weeks apart.
on december 12, 2020, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued an interim recommendation* for use of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥16 years for the prevention of covid-19.
to guide its deliberations regarding the vaccine, acip employed the evidence to recommendation (etr) framework,† using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (grade) approach.§ the recommendation for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with acip’s interim recommendation for allocating initial supplies of covid-19 vaccines (2).
the acip recommendation for the use of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine under eua is interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available.
what are the implications for public health practice?
on december 13, 2020, this report was posted online as an mmwr early release.
the body of evidence for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine was primarily informed by one large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii/iii clinical trial that enrolled >43,000 participants (median age = 52 years, range = 16–91 years) (5,6).
interim findings from this clinical trial, using data from participants with a median of 2 months of follow-up, indicate that the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine was 95.0% effective (95% confidence interval = 90.3%–97.6%) in preventing symptomatic laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in persons without evidence of previous sars-cov-2 infection.
start highlightconsistent high efficacy (≥92%) was observed across age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions.
efficacy was similarly high in a secondary analysis including participants both with or without evidence of previous sars-cov-2 infection.end highlight although numbers of observed hospitalizations and deaths were low, the available data were consistent with reduced risk for these severe outcomes among vaccinated persons compared with that among placebo recipients.
among vaccine recipients, reactogenicity symptoms, defined as solicited local injection site or systemic reactions during the 7 days after vaccination, were frequent and mostly mild to moderate.
systemic adverse reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were generally more frequent and severe in persons aged 18–55 years than in those aged >55 years.
systemic adverse reactions had a median onset of 1–2 days after vaccine receipt and resolved in a median of 1 day.
severe local and systemic adverse reactions (grade ≥3, defined as interfering with daily activity) occurred more commonly in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients.
among vaccine recipients, 8.8% reported any grade ≥3 reaction; the most common symptoms were fatigue (4.2%), headache (2.4%), muscle pain (1.8%), chills (1.7%), and injection site pain (1.4%).
generally, grade ≥3 reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were less prevalent in older than in younger participants.
serious adverse events¶ were observed in a similar proportion of vaccine (0.6%) and placebo (0.5%) recipients and encompassed medical events occurring at a frequency similar to that within the general population (6).
no specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, or previous sars-cov-2 infection.
a detailed summary of safety data, including information on reactogenicity, is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-manufacturer/pfizer/reactogenicity.html.
since june 2020, acip has convened nine public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of covid-19 and the potential use of covid-19 vaccines, including the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine (3).
within the etr framework, acip considered the importance of the public health problem of covid-19, as well as issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients’ values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, and equity for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine.
to inform the etr framework, the covid-19 vaccines work group, comprising experts in infectious disease, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, held 27 meetings to review covid-19 surveillance data, evidence for vaccine efficacy and safety, and implementation considerations for covid-19 vaccines, including the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine.
after a systematic review of the literature, the work group used the grade approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the vaccine, rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty) (4).
work group conclusions regarding the evidence for the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine were presented to acip at public meetings.

from the grade evidence assessment, the level of certainty for the benefits of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine was type 1 (high certainty) for the prevention of symptomatic covid-19.
evidence was type 3 (low certainty) for the estimate of prevention of covid-19–associated hospitalization and type 4 (very low certainty) for the estimate of prevention of death.
data on hospitalizations and deaths are limited at this time, but a vaccine that effectively prevents symptomatic infection is expected to also prevent hospitalizations and deaths.
regarding potential harms after vaccination, evidence was type 2 (moderate certainty) for serious adverse events and type 1 (high certainty) for reactogenicity.
no data were available to assess the efficacy for prevention of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection.
data reviewed within the etr framework supported the use of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine.
acip determined that covid-19 is a major public health problem and that use of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine is a reasonable and efficient allocation of resources.
whereas there might be uncertainty in how all populations value the vaccine, it was determined that for most populations, the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects.
the vaccine is probably acceptable to implementation stakeholders and feasible to implement in spite of difficult ultracold-chain storage and requirements for handling and administration.
these requirements could limit the availability of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine to some populations thereby negatively impacting health equity.
therefore, efforts should be made to overcome these challenges and advance health equity.

what is added by this report?
adverse events that occur in a recipient after receipt of covid-19 vaccine should be reported to the vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers).
fda requires that vaccination providers report vaccination administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and cases of covid-19 that result in hospitalization or death after administration of covid-19 vaccine under eua.
reporting is encouraged for any clinically significant adverse event, whether or not it is clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event.
information on how to submit a report to vaers is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.htmlexternal icon or 1-800-822-7967.
in addition, cdc has developed a new, voluntary smartphone-based tool, v-safe, that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide near real-time health check-ins after patients receive covid-19 vaccination.
the cdc/v-safe call center follows up on reports to v-safe that indicate a medically significant health impact to collect additional information for completion of a vaers report.
information on v-safe is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vsafe.
