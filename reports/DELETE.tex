the abstract still doesnt have the results portion


1. Intro: 
(max 4 page) background
(scope, objective, report organization): 1 page each 

2. Literature Review (12-20 pages)
*Should i put word embedding info here instead
*Review the 4 approaches to tackle OOV

half a paragraph for failed experiments, the rest is good results

3. Proposed approaches & specs
*put the inspiration and limitation here

*How to present the architecture (some of them failed) 
Methodology 
Definition and Assumptions
Agile
System workflow 
Component specs (data source, etc)
Tools and framework (torch, wandb, etc) 
Computing resources


4 Implementation
* Corpus Prep (wiki download, giga download)
* Preprocessing (regex and related) 
* Data prep (extraction of context words) 
* Vocab Prep (what words to extract -- merriam webster + negative sampling) 
* Training (hyperparameter choice and final network design)
* Metrics selection 
* Monitoring (tracking metrics, data versioning, logging, output savings)
* Testing (using metrics and downstream analogy task) 
* Different level of testings (random test, batch test, custom test)  
* Deployment (notebook to modify the glove embedding and necessary files )


Experiment results
* pull from wandb 


Extension
* code switch, 
Discussion and Future Work




*other approaches 

* metrics where to put 
* discussion of metrics 
* need to put vocab for NLP, OOV, ...
