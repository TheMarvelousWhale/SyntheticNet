in fact, the incorrect set-up "led to the issue persisting throughout the series of five batches", the investigation showed.
the companies and japan's health ministry have said the particles of stainless steel did not pose any additional health risk.

but a fourth lot failed inspection after the discovery of particles on jul 2, and a fifth lot was also held back by rovi.
the problems with lots 4 and 5 were reported to moderna, takeda and japan's health ministry, but the first three lots were released for use because they "had passed inspection and were not considered to be impacted".

tokyo: japan's takeda pharmaceutical said on friday (oct 1) that "human error" caused metal contaminants to get into moderna covid-19 vaccine doses, leading to a recall.
a total of five, sequential lots of the moderna covid-19 vaccine manufactured at rovi between jun 27 and jul 3 were investigated.
the first three were shipped to japan and later recalled after the discovery of particles, later determined to be stainless steel, inside 39 vials.
takeda, which imports and distributes the vaccine in japan, and moderna said in a new report that a spanish manufacturer discovered contaminants in some vials in july, but supplies from the same production were allowed to be shipped to japan.
the new report said that the problem stemmed from "incorrect assembly and was due to human error specific to visually misjudging the required 1mm gap between the star-wheel and the stopper" of machinery that put the tops on vaccine vials.
japanese authorities in august suspended the use of three batches of moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses after being notified of the contamination.
moderna conducted an investigation in partnership with takeda and spanish manufacturer rovi, which operates the plant where the contamination occurred.

japan: 1.6 million moderna vaccine doses recalled; novavax replacement deal signed
<<p>>
takeda and the japanese government had signed two deals to import a total 100 million doses of moderna’s vaccine.
rovi manufactures the vaccine’s api in granada, spain, and does dose manufacture, vial filling, and packaging in madrid.
rovi signed the dose deal in july 2020, adding equipment and staff to its madrid site.
after signing the api contract service agreement in april this year, rovi added a line at its granada facility that can produce 100 million doses per year.
separately, some doses of the vaccine were found to be contaminated with material from the rubber stoppers.
the rubber fragments are believed to have entered the vaccine due to incorrectly inserted needles.
novavax deal replaces moderna doses takeda announced a new deal with the japanese government on september 7 for 150 million doses of novavax’s vaccine candidate (known as tak-019), to be manufactured in japan by takeda.
takeda will begin manufacturing in japan in early 2022, subject to the vaccine’s regulatory approval.
novavax is licensing manufacturing technologies to takeda so that the latter can manufacture the vaccine antigen.
novavax is supplying the matrix-m adjuvant.
the vaccine is in phase ii in japan and phase iii in the us and eu.
japan has also signed deals for 120 million doses of astrazeneca’s (cambridge, uk) vaccine and 194 million doses of pfizer inc (new york, ny, us)/biontech se’s (mainz, germany) vaccine, the globaldata covid-19 vaccination dashboard shows.
according to the globaldata covid-19 vaccination dashboard, 155 million covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in japan, equivalent to 1,225 doses per 1,000 people.

on september 1, takeda and moderna suspended three lots of the spikevax vaccine containing 163,000 vials, equivalent to 1.63 million doses, after reports of particulate in vials.
rovi discovered the particulate was stainless steel, “related to friction between two pieces of metal installed in the stoppering module of the production line due to an incorrect set-up” during a line changeover.
the companies issued a statement saying that “the rare presence of stainless steel particles in the moderna covid-19 vaccine does not pose an undue risk to patient safety and it does not adversely affect the benefit/risk profile of the product… metallic particles of this size injected into a muscle may result in a local reaction, but are unlikely to result in other adverse reactions beyond the local site of the injection.”						 					 about 500,000 people have had shots from the three suspended batches.
japan’s ministry of health, labour and welfare (mhlw) has announced three deaths in men who received the moderna vaccine; the companies said that there is “no evidence” that the deaths are related to the vaccine.
“the relationship with vaccination is unknown,” said the mhlw in a statement.
takeda and the japanese government had signed two deals to import a total 100 million doses of moderna’s vaccine.

4 charts show why moderna vaccine recipients may not need boosters as much as people who got pfizer's vaccine
<<p>>
 good
another cdc report released earlier in september suggested that moderna's two-dose vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by 93%.
for pfizer's vaccine that figure was 88%, and for johnson & johnson's it was 71%.
pfizer's vaccine during that same period was roughly 82% effective among 30- to 49-year-olds and 84% effective among 50- to 64-year-olds.

booster doses are most recommended for adults age 65 and up, who generally don't have the same kind of strong, lasting immune response to vaccines as younger people.
both vaccines are still great at preventing severe disease and hospitalization, especially in adults under 65.
emerging evidence suggests that people on #teammoderna may not need a booster as much as others.
a leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.
a study of hospitals in new york, minnesota, wisconsin, utah, california, oregon, washington, indiana, and colorado found that moderna's vaccine was associated with a lower proportion of hospitalizations than pfizer's or j&j's among vaccinated people.
this data, collected from hospitals in 20 cities, suggested that moderna's vaccine protected people against hospitalization for longer than pfizer's and johnson & johnson's vaccines.
last week, the centers for disease control and prevention released data sets from hospitals around the country.
that data is starting to indicate that people who got moderna's vaccine are less likely to be hospitalized than people who got pfizer's or johnson & johnson's.
dr. robert atmar, who's leading a pivotal covid-19 booster study at baylor college of medicine, said that while he wouldn't be surprised if j&j vaccine recipients got a booster recommendation soon, "for the moderna, it is an open question."
it's tough to know exactly how the arrival of the delta variant in the spring may be affecting how well the vaccines work.
these estimates of vaccine effectiveness, broken down by age group, come from data on over 74,000 hospitalizations across 187 hospitals nationwide.
but data from five veterans-affairs medical centers in the us suggested that moderna's vaccine was superior at protecting older adults, with an effectiveness of 87% against hospitalization in patients 65 and up.
pfizer's vaccine was 77% effective in that same group.
in adults 18 to 29, the two vaccines performed almost identically, with vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization of 82% for moderna and 85% for pfizer.
this data, taken from more than 250 hospitals across 14 states, combines pfizer's and moderna's vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in one chart.
it indicates that the vast majority of covid-19 cases and deaths nationwide are among unvaccinated people.
we can see that moderna outperformed pfizer among adults 30 to 64.
from june to august, moderna's vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 99% among 30- to 49-year-olds and 91% among 50- to 64-year-olds.
moderna's shot consists of 100 micrograms of mrna vaccine, while pfizer's has 30 micrograms.
that may mean lighter side effects for pfizer's shot — but in the long run, the protection might not be as strong.
after four months, moderna's vaccine remained 92% effective at preventing hospitalization, while pfizer's was 77% effective and j&j's was 68%.
"we will not boost our way out of this pandemic," cdc director rochelle walensky said during a white house covid-19 briefing on friday.
"the most vulnerable are those unvaccinated."

in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “may,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “aims,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.
the forward-looking statements in this summary and faq are neither promises nor guarantees, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond moderna’s control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
these risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others: the fact that there has never been a commercial product utilizing mrna technology approved for use; the fact that the rapid response technology in use by moderna is still being developed and implemented; and those other risks and uncertainties described under the heading “risk factors” in moderna’s most recent annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) and in subsequent filings made by moderna with the sec, which are available on the sec’s website at www.sec.gov.
except as required by law, moderna disclaims any intention or responsibility for updating or revising any forward-looking statements contained in this summary and faq in the event of new information, future developments or otherwise.
these forward-looking statements are based on moderna’s current expectations and speak only as of the date hereof.
1 any emergency use would be subject to authorization by the appropriate regulatory agencies, based on the emergence of clinical data for mrna-1273 that would support use of the vaccine prior to licensure.2 as has previously been disclosed, the ability of the company to make millions of doses per month is contingent on investments in the scale up and further buildout of the company’s existing manufacturing infrastructure.
moderna covid-19 vaccine is authorized for use under an emergency use authorization (eua) for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older.
moderna covid-19 vaccine is investigational and not approved by fda.
the first participant was dosed in the phase 1/2 study of moderna’s vaccine candidate against covid-19 in japan, led by takeda pharmaceutical co., ltd.

forward looking statements
important safety information
since 2010, moderna has focused on building our mrna technology platform by leveraging the role mrna plays in instructing cells to create proteins.
our platform produces mrna that can be delivered to cells without provoking an immune response against the mrna itself.
moderna is using this platform to pursue mrna medicines for a broad spectrum of diseases.
before there was ever a covid-19 pandemic, our ten years of research and clinical trials taught us valuable lessons about designing both mrna therapeutics and mrna vaccines.
this includes, in particular, how to manufacture and formulate mrna that can produce the targeted proteins – the spike protein, in the case of coronaviruses like the sars-cov-2 virus – in the body.
clinical trials of our mrna vaccine candidates against a variety of viruses have repeatedly demonstrated that they induce the desired immune response.
learn about our
moderna announced new capital investments to increase capacity at its owned and partnered manufacturing facilities, which it expects will increase global 2022 capacity to approximately 1.4 billion doses of its covid-19 vaccine, assuming a 100 μg dose.
takeda pharmaceutical co., ltd submitted a new drug application to the government of japan’s ministry of health, labour and welfare (mhlw) to import and distribute moderna’s vaccine candidate against covid-19 in japan.
once the covid-19 pandemic struck, we were well positioned to adapt our existing mrna technology to try to address the global public health crisis.
we worked closely with the nih and other government and non-government partners to design and implement a robust covid-19 vaccine clinical trial program that prioritized safety.
our speed in developing the moderna covid-19 vaccine was ultimately a product of our many years of research and investment in mrna vaccines.
interim safety and primary efficacy results from the phase 3 cove study of the moderna covid-19 vaccine were published in the new england journal of medicine.
results from in vitro neutralization studies of sera from individuals vaccinated with moderna covid-19 vaccine showing activity against emerging strains of sars-cov-2.
moderna completed manufacturing of clinical trial material for its variant-specific vaccine candidate, mrna-1273.351, against the sars-cov-2 variant known as b.1.351 and shipped doses to the nih for a phase 1 clinical trial that will be led and funded by niaid.

vaccine candidate
the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s (cdc) advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) voted to recommend the use of the moderna covid-19 vaccine in people 18 years of age and older under the emergency use authorization (eua) issued by the u.s. fda.
by the time of the covid-19 pandemic, we had already been working for years on vaccines for infectious diseases, including on other coronaviruses and their spike proteins.
as part of our mrna technology platform, we had also already developed an mrna delivery system that was specifically designed for vaccines.

moderna covid-19 vaccine overview and safety
<<p>>
clinical trials for the moderna vaccine included people from the following racial, ethnic, age, and sex categories:
twenty-two (22%) of people who participated in the clinical trials had at least one condition that put them at risk of severe illness from covid-19.
the most frequent underlying medical conditions among participants were lung disease, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or hiv infection.
four percent (4%) of participants had two or more high-risk conditions.
most people who participated in the trials (82%) were considered to have an occupational risk of exposure, with 25% of them being healthcare workers.
 polski
cdc now recommends that people aged 65 years and older, residents aged 18 years and older in long-term care settings, and people aged 50–64 years with underlying medical conditions should receive a booster shot of pfizer-biontech’s covid-19 vaccine at least 6 months after completing their pfizer-biontech primary series.
other groups may receive a booster shot based on their individual risk and benefit.

the moderna covid-19 (mrna-1273) vaccine: what you need to know
<<p>>
should pregnant women be vaccinated?
sage recommends that all vaccinees be observed for at least 15 minutes after vaccination.
those who experience an immediate severe allergic reaction to the first dose should not receive additional doses.
compliance with the full schedule is recommended and the same product should be used for both doses.
as more vaccine becomes available, additional priority groups should be vaccinated, with attention to people disproportionately affected by covid-19 or who face health inequities.
feature stories
here is what you need to know.
studies have shown a high public health impact where the interval has been longer than that recommended by the eul.
accordingly, countries facing a high incidence of covid-19 combined with severe vaccine supply constraints could consider delaying the second dose up to 12 weeks in order to achieve a higher first dose coverage in high priority populations.
the comorbidities studied in in the phase 3 clinical trial included chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection.
vaccination is recommended for persons with such comorbidities that have been identified as increasing the risk of severe covid-19.
this article was revised on 29 january 2021 to include a section dedicated to pregnant women, but the recommendations remain the same.
longer-term safety assessment involves continued follow up of clinical trial participants, as well as specific studies and continued surveillance of secondary effects or adverse events of those being vaccinated in the roll out.

sage recommends the use of the moderna mrna-1273 vaccine at a schedule of two doses (100 µg, 0.5 ml each) 28 days apart.
if necessary, the interval between the doses may be extended to 42 days.
individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take this or any other mrna vaccine.
vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults.
who recommends the use of the vaccine in lactating women as in other adults.
who does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.
as with all covid-19 vaccines, health workers at high risk of exposure and older people should be prioritized for vaccination.
based on the evidence so far, the new variants of sars-cov-2, including the b.1.1.7 and the 501y.v2, do not alter the effectiveness of the moderna mrna vaccine.
the monitoring, collection and analysis of data on new variants and their impact on the effectiveness of covid-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines continues.
persons living with hiv are at higher risk of severe covid-19 disease.
known hiv-positive vaccine recipients should be provided with information and counselling.
related
the global advisory committee on vaccine safety, a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to the who on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international impact.
the ema has thoroughly assessed the data on the quality, safety and efficacy of the moderna covid-19 vaccine and authorized its use across the european union.
on 30 april, who listed the moderna vaccine for emergency use.
who’s emergency use listing (eul) assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of covid-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for covax facility vaccine supply.
news
in the meantime, we must maintain public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.
updated 25 june 2021, pursuant to updated interim recommendations
the who strategic advisory group of experts (sage) has issued interim recommendations for the use of the moderna covid-19 (mrna-1273) vaccine against covid-19.
this article provides a summary of those interim recommendations; you may access the full guidance document here.
although further studies are required for immunocompromised persons, people in this category who are part of a group recommended for vaccination may be vaccinated after receiving information and counselling.
who recommends the use of the covid-19 vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks.
to help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of covid-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women.
who does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination.
who does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.
vaccination can be offered to people who have had covid-19 in the past.
but individuals may wish to defer their own covid-19 vaccination for up to six months from the time of sars-cov-2 infection.
the vaccine should not be administered to persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies.
we do not know whether the vaccine will prevent infection and protect against onward transmission.
immunity persists for several months, but the full duration is not yet known.
these important questions are being studied.
while vaccination is recommended for older persons due to the high risk of severe covid-19 and death, very frail older persons with an anticipated life expectancy of less than 3 months should be individually assessed.
the moderna vaccine has been shown to have an efficacy of approximately 94.1 per cent in protecting against covid-19, starting 14 days after the first dose.

moderna vs. pfizer: both knockouts, but one seems to have the edge
<<p>>
there is limited evidence showing the effect of that dose, and none on how long the higher antibody levels might last.
federal regulators are reviewing moderna’s data to determine whether the available data are sufficient to authorize a booster shot of the half dose.
the two vaccines have diverged more sharply in their efficacy against infection.
protection from both waned over time, particularly after the arrival of the delta variant, but the pfizer-biontech vaccine’s values fell lower.
in two of the recent studies, the moderna vaccine did better at preventing illness by more than 30 percentage points.
it was a constant refrain from federal health officials after the coronavirus vaccines were authorized: these shots are all equally effective.
roughly 221 million doses of the pfizer-biontech vaccine have been dispensed thus far in the united states, compared with about 150 million doses of moderna’s vaccine.
in a half-dozen studies published over the past few weeks, moderna’s vaccine appeared to be more protective than the pfizer-biontech vaccine in the months after immunization.

the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines rely on the same mrna platform, and in the initial clinical trials, they had remarkably similar efficacy against symptomatic infection: 95 percent for pfizer-biontech and 94 percent for moderna.
this was in part why they were described as more or less equivalent.
even in the original clinical trials of the three vaccines eventually authorized in the united states — made by pfizer-biontech, moderna and johnson & johnson — it was clear that the j.&j.
vaccine had a lower efficacy than the other two.
research since then has borne out that trend, although j.&j.
announced this week that a second dose of its vaccine boosts its efficacy to levels comparable to the others.
“at the end of the day, i do think there are subtle but real differences between moderna and pfizer,” dr. jeffrey wilson, an immunologist and physician at the university of virginia in charlottesville who was a co-author of one such study, published in jama network open this month.
“in high-risk populations, it might be relevant.
it’d be good if people took a close look.”

vaccine manufacturers would typically have enough time to test a range of doses before choosing one — and they have done such testing for their trials of the coronavirus vaccine in children.

but the discrepancy is small and the real-world consequences uncertain, because both vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, she and others cautioned.
scientists who were initially skeptical of the reported differences between the moderna and pfizer-biontech vaccines have slowly become convinced that the disparity is small but real.
the extra week may give immune cells more time to proliferate before the second dose, said dr. paul burton, moderna’s chief medical officer.
“we need to keep studying this and to do more research, but i think it’s plausible.”
moderna’s efficacy against severe illness in those studies ranged from 92 to 100 percent.
pfizer-biontech’s numbers trailed by 10 to 15 percentage points.
scientists had initially hoped that the vaccines would have an efficacy of 50 or 60 percent.
“we would have all seen that as great result and been happy with it,” he said.
“fast forward to now, and we’re debating whether 96.3 percent vaccine efficacy for moderna versus 88.8 percent for pfizer is a big deal.”
several factors might underlie the divergence.
the vaccines differ in their dosing and in the time between the first and second doses.
but in the midst of a pandemic last year, the companies had to guess at the optimal dose.
pfizer went with 30 micrograms, moderna with 100.
“it’s not appropriate for people who took pfizer to be freaking out that they got an inferior vaccine.”
for example, the pfizer-biontech vaccine was rolled out weeks before moderna’s to priority groups — older adults and health care workers.
immunity wanes more quickly in older adults, so a decline observed in a group consisting mostly of older adults may give the false impression that the protection from the pfizer-biontech vaccine falls off quickly.
a series of studies found that the moderna vaccine seemed to be more protective as the months passed than the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
here’s why.
“yes, likely a real difference, probably reflecting what’s in the two vials,” said john moore, a virologist at weill cornell medicine in new york.
“but truly, how much does this difference matter in the real world?”
the subtleties emerged over time.
the vaccines have never been directly compared in a carefully designed study, so the data indicating that effects vary are based mostly on observations.
moderna’s vaccine relies on a lipid nanoparticle that can deliver the larger dose.
and the first and second shots of that vaccine are staggered by four weeks, compared with three for the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
“our baseline assumption is that the mrna vaccines are functioning similarly, but then you start to see a separation,” said natalie dean, a biostatistician at emory university in atlanta.
“it’s not a huge difference, but at least it’s consistent.”
results from those studies can be skewed by any number of factors, including the location, the age of the population vaccinated, when they were immunized and the timing between the doses, dr. dean said.
if the efficacy gap continues to widen, it may have implications for the debate on booster shots.
federal agencies this week are evaluating the need for a third shot of the pfizer-biontech vaccine for some high-risk groups, including older adults.
“pfizer is a big hammer,” dr. wilson added, but “moderna is a sledgehammer.”
but by now, the observational studies have delivered results from a number of locations — qatar, the mayo clinic in minnesota, several other states in the united states — and in health care workers, hospitalized veterans or the general population.
moderna’s team recently showed that a half dose of the vaccine still sent antibody levels soaring.
based on those data, the company asked the f.d.a.
this month to authorize 50 micrograms, the half dose, as a booster shot.
given those caveats, “i’m not convinced that there truly is a difference,” said dr. bill gruber, a senior vice president at pfizer.
“i don’t think there’s sufficient data out there to make that claim.”
that has turned out not to be true.
research published on friday by the centers for disease control and prevention found that the efficacy of the pfizer-biontech vaccine against hospitalization fell from 91 percent to 77 percent after a four-month period following the second shot.
the moderna vaccine showed no decline over the same period.
the latest such study, published on wednesday in the new england journal of medicine, evaluated the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness in about 5,000 health care workers in 25 states.
the study found that the pfizer-biontech vaccine had an effectiveness of 88.8 percent, compared with moderna’s 96.3 percent.
still, other experts said that the corpus of evidence pointed to a disparity that would be worth exploring, at least in people who respond weakly to vaccines, including older adults and immunocompromised people.
a few studies found that the levels of antibodies produced by the pfizer-biontech vaccine were one-third to one-half those produced by the moderna vaccine.
yet that decrease is trivial, dr. moore said: for comparison, there is a more than 100-fold difference in the antibody levels among healthy individuals.
ultimately, both vaccines are still holding steady against severe illness and hospitalization, especially in people under 65, dr. moore said.
