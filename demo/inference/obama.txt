 						barack obama
<<p>>
in 1992, obama married michelle robinson, a lawyer who had also excelled at harvard law.
their daughters, malia and sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
obama was elected to the illinois senate in 1996, and then to the u.s. senate in 2004.
at the democratic national convention that summer, he delivered a much acclaimed keynote address.
some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most did not expect it to happen for some time.
nevertheless, in 2008 he was elected over arizona senator john mccain by 365 to 173 electoral votes.
when barack obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first african american to hold the office.
the framers of the constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to americans of wealth or family connections.
subject to the prejudices of their time—many of them owned slaves—most would not have foreseen an african american president.
obama’s father, barack sr., a kenyan economist, met his mother, stanley ann dunham, when both were students in hawaii, where barack was born on august 4, 1961.
they later divorced, and barack’s mother married a man from indonesia, where he spent his early childhood.
before fifth grade, he returned to honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend punahou school on scholarship.
the presidential biographies on whitehouse.gov are from “the presidents of the united states of america,” by frank freidel and hugh sidey.

 							the 44th president of the united states
learn more about barack obama’s spouse, michelle obama.
barack obama served as the 44th president of the united states.
his story is the american story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.
as an incoming president, obama faced many challenges—an economic collapse, wars in iraq and afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism.
inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew america’s stature in the world.
during his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation’s financial institutions.
obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection.
in 2009, obama became the fourth president to receive the nobel peace prize.
in the last year of his second term, obama spoke at two events that clearly moved him—the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from selma to montgomery, and the dedication of the national museum of african american history and culture.
“our union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer,” he said in selma.
“and that’s why we celebrate,” he told those attending the museum opening in washington, “mindful that our work is not yet done.”
 the white house 								1600 pennsylvania ave nw 								washington, dc 20500
in 2012, he was reelected over former massachusetts governor mitt romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes.
the middle east remained a key foreign policy challenge.
obama had overseen the killing of osama bin laden, but a new self-proclaimed islamic state arose during a civil war in syria and began inciting terrorist attacks.
obama sought to manage a hostile iran with a treaty that hindered its development of nuclear weapons.
the obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.
in his memoir dreams from my father (1995), obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence.
after two years at occidental college in los angeles, he transferred to columbia university, where he studied political science and international relations.
following graduation in 1983, obama worked in new york city, then became a community organizer on the south side of chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures.
in 1988, he went to harvard law school, where he attracted national attention as the first african american president of the harvard law review.
returning to chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.

<<h1>>
 situation room where obama watched bin laden raid is getting an overhaul
<<p>>
the situation room, though a highly secure space, hasn't had its equipment updated in 15 years.
................................ advertisement ................................
it also has been the site of less momentous events.
in december 2017, it's where trump's chief of staff, john kelly, fired trump adviser and former "apprentice" celebrity omarosa manigault newman.
despite the room's reputation for tight security, she secretly taped the conversation.
the image shows obama and top advisers crammed together in a small room.
this year, biden and his team were gathering for an update on the airlift evacuation from afghanistan when he learned of the aug. 26 terrorist attack at kabul airport.
the most famous photo was what then-white house photographer pete souza called "frame 210" taken on may 1, 2011: president barack obama and his national security team watching a live drone video beamed into a laptop and listening to a satellite-radio feed of the seal team 6 raid that killed bin laden, the mastermind of the sept. 11 attacks.
most famous
the pentagon request to shift funds to the defense information systems agency for the situation room is part of a "reprogramming" request for unspent fiscal 2021 funds that congress is reviewing.
in addition, $10 million is being requested as part of the still-pending fiscal 2022 budget, according to agency spokesman dillon mcconnell.
not surprisingly, much of what that spending will support is classified, like the full capabilities of the situation room itself.

during president donald trump's term, the white house released an october 2019 photo of him in the situation room watching the commando raid that killed al-baghdadi, the isis leader, in syria.
"i kind of walked him through what he can expect," webb said.
track latest news live on ndtv.com and get news updates from india and around the world.
tense moments
intelligence agencies also are participating in the upgrade and its funding, the person familiar with the project said.
the multilayered system includes equipment such as servers at off-site locations and is protected by layers of backup, encryption and hardening against physical attack, the person said.
souza later wrote that "the president stood up to shake hands with general webb and a few others" but "there was no cheering or fist-bumping.
it was an oddly subdued reaction to a historic moment."
then "everybody kind of naturally migrated," and "they float in over the series of the hours," he said.
first was then-vice president biden, who asked "hey general, what's going on?"
now the pentagon has proposed shifting almost $46 million previously approved for other programs to accelerate an ongoing overhaul, adding to about $44 million backed by congress for the project since fiscal 2017 and $10 million requested for fiscal 2022, according to pentagon budget documents.
but the situation room is also a technology throwback, with some equipment that hasn't been updated in 15 years.
"sit room" staff provide 24-hour monitoring of international developments, according to the nonprofit white house museum.
a person familiar with the operation, who discussed the secure facility on condition of anonymity, said its staff also connects calls with heads of state and monitors major domestic events.
then "it kind of got busy," webb said.
he said he looked around and found, "whoa, everybody's in here," including obama, who let webb keep his seat.
webb is seen in uniform in the center of the white house photo.
"i spent a lot of time explaining to them what was going to occur" but "as more people came in, i just unplugged" the laptop headset "so they could hear the audio."
that included the now famous "geronimo ekia" call sign by a commando on the ground signaling that bin laden was dead.
the money sought for improvements "will continue to upgrade and secure critical systems that support classified voice, data and video used in the white house situation room and throughout the national security council" for the president, vice president and senior staff, according to the document.
webb, who's now the three-star commander of the air education and training command, said he was told by white house staff that he wasn't authorized to have access to the president but "you can set up your stuff.
if we have a question, we'll come get you."
so webb and a tech sergeant operated a laptop in a small annex in the situation room complex to monitor the raid in pakistan.
(except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)
the situation room is actually a series of rooms, a command center on the lower level of the white house's west wing for the president and senior administration officials to conduct secure briefings and calls.
watch live news:
"as the president arrived in the situation room, one of the first updates he received, of course, was about the attacks on the ground in kabul," press secretary jen psaki said at the time.
commanders on the ground and the region, using the secure communications link to the nerve center of the white house, gave biden briefings as updates rolled in.
funds are required for renovations that will "update the security and technology" since the last renovation in 2006, including "audio-visual improvements to enable broadcast quality display and production capability to include flexible infrastructure for rapid upgrades," according to a defense department budget document for fiscal 2022.

some of the funding would also upgrade systems used at locations outside washington, known as "continuity of government" sites, that were created during the cold war in case of a catastrophic attack on the nation's capital.
air force lieutenant general brad webb, who was a one-star general and an air force tech sergeant for the secretive joint special operations command, explained in an interview how that came about.
it's the highly secure space in the white house where presidents have gone to watch video feeds as us forces killed terrorists osama bin laden and abu bakr al-baghdadi.
it's where president joe biden learned in august that a suicide bomber killed 13 american service members in kabul.
the situation room has been the site of many tense and historical moments since it was created in may 1961 "out of frustration on the part of president kennedy after the failed bay of pigs invasion," according to the white house museum.

<<h1>>
barack obama: tax the rich, including me, to fund biden spending plan
<<p>>
amid coverage of such a high-stakes political moment, the cnn commentator chris cilizza said biden, a senator since 1973 and twice a presidential candidate before winning the white house in 2020, was now in “the most important week of his life”.
in an intervention perhaps designed to appeal to democratic loyalties, he told abc biden was “asking the wealthiest of americans, who have benefited incredibly over the last several decades – and even in the midst of a pandemic, saw their wealth and assets rise enormously – to pay a few percentage points more in taxes in order to make sure that we have a economy that’s fair for everybody.
“you’re looking at making our infrastructure function more efficiently ... you’re talking about rebuilding a lot of buildings, roads, bridges, ports so that they are fortified against climate change.
and also, that we start investing in the kinds of energy efficiency that’s going to be required to battle climate change.”
“i think anybody who pretends that it’s a hardship for billionaires to pay a little bit more in taxes so that a single mom gets childcare support or so that we can make sure that our communities aren’t inundated by wildfires and floods and that we’re doing something about climate change for the next generation – you know, that’s an argument that is unsustainable.”
republicans and business groups oppose corporate and personal tax increases in the biden spending package, which is priced at $3.5tn and aims to improve healthcare, childcare, the fight against climate change and other democratic priorities.
biden was vice-president to obama, who remains broadly popular.
barack obama says wealthy americans – including himself – can afford tax increases to help fund joe biden’s ambitious spending plan.
the house speaker, nancy pelosi, has indicated the price tag of the spending plan will come down, via talks between moderates and progressives also aimed at passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill.
most observers say failure to pass the build back better act will be disastrous for biden and his party before midterm elections next year.
nonetheless, it is an argument republicans and corporate groups are prepared to mount.
in congress, republicans oppose attempts to simultaneously fund the government past friday and raise the debt ceiling, thereby avoiding a us default.
obama is reckoned to have a personal fortune of around $70m.
since leaving the white house in 2017 he has released a bestselling memoir as part of a $65m book deal and with his wife, michelle obama, signed a netflix deal thought to be worth more than $100m.
he spoke to abc to mark the start of construction at his presidential library, in chicago.
“i think they can afford it,” obama told abc’s good morning america.
“we can afford it.
i put myself in this category now.”
“you’re talking about us stepping up and spending money on providing childcare tax credits,” obama said.
“making those permanent to help families, who for a long time, have needed help.
democrats have pointed to their votes to raise the ceiling under donald trump, and to republicans’ contribution to the national debt via 2017 tax cuts which disproportionately benefited the wealthy.
on monday house democrats wrote to mitch mcconnell, the senate minority leader, urging him to “avert a manufactured crisis”.

former president says billionaires should ‘pay a little bit more in taxes’ to fund healthcare, childcare and the climate crisis fight
later, the senate voted on a measure to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling.
republicans blocked it.
the spending plan must pass via reconciliation, which allows budgetary legislation to pass on bare majorities, negating the 60-vote filibuster in the evenly split senate.
pelosi, the senate majority leader, chuck schumer, and the biden white house have little room for error.

meghan markle channels michelle obama's inauguration outfit in new york
<<p>>
another unique detail was its pockets, which were framed with a lighter shade of square-shaped lining.
the designer outfit and estimated $387,000 worth of jewels raised eyebrows given 94 per cent of children at the school they were visiting receive free meals.
markle, who wore her hair in a sleek bun the day before, also seemed to take inspiration from obama's inauguration day hairstyle
markle and harry, 37,  kicked off the first day of their tour thursday when they paid their respects to the victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks at ground zero.
'turns out british vogue famously has a back page q&a feature that is equal parts informative and whimsical, with a special guest each month,' she wrote in the magazine.

the duchess of sussex, 40, donned a $5,840 loro piana cashmere coat, matching $1,685 wide-leg pants, and red manolo blahnik pointed-toe pumps while visiting harlem's ps 123 mahalia jackson school.
meghan markle took a page out of michelle obama's stylebook on friday when she stepped out in new york in a monochromatic maroon suit — a look strikingly similar to the much-lauded outfit the former first lady wore to president joe biden's inauguration.
markle's version of the monochromatic suit was more relaxed, likely because she would be sitting down and reading her new children's book the bench to second-graders.
like the former first lady, markle had her hair styled in loose curls, though she opted to have her dark locks parted in the middle instead of to the side.
the sussexes posed for photos with students at ps 123 mahalia jackson school as they showed the couple a mural in the yard
markle completed the look with a black — not red — face mask that looked just like the one obama paired with her suit eight months ago.
markle accessorized the look with matching pumps and gold jewelry, including a $4,500 diamond ring by birks, princess diana's $23,000 cartier tank watch, a $6,900 cartier love bracelet, a $3,000 jennifer meyer tennis bracelet, and her diamond engagement ring, which is estimated to be worth about $350,000.
social media users were baffled by her wardrobe choices, with one person asking: 'does she never learn how to wear clothes that suit the occasion and weather?
it's a hot and humid day in new york and she is wearing a high collar and coat.'
'she's giving michelle at inauguration and i am here for it #flawless,' one fan tweeted.
they later met with the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, linda thomas-greenfield, to discuss racial justice.
her reversible coat is made from double-faced cashmere, features hand-finished invisible seams, and comes complete with a ribbed, cashmere-knit, detachable collar.
while markle opted for a head-to-toe red, prince harry donned beige chinos and a long-sleeve navy polo shirt that he wore open at the collar
'my first thought was that it needed to be someone kind, inspirational, motivating, funny, with gravitas and as much depth as levity.
my second thought: it needed to be michelle obama.'
the couple also visited the offices of the world health organization (who), where they held a meeting with chelsea clinton, health officials, and other experts to discuss vaccine equity ahead of their appearance at saturday's global citizen concert.
the mother of two, who wore her hair in a sleek bun the day before, also seemed to take inspiration from obama's inauguration day hairstyle.
they left their children archie, two, and lilibet, three months, at home in california during their visit, which will last at least three nights and marks their longest time away from their newborn daughter.

before they met with the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, linda thomas-greenfield later that day, markle changed into an unseasonably warm-looking camel-colored coat
obama cut a stylish figure in a head-to-toe plum suit by sergio hudson when she watched biden and vice president kamala harris be sworn into office at the capitol in january.
markle was initially bundled up in a black coat, a turtle neck, and wide-legged trousers — despite the weather being a humid 80 degrees fahrenheit in the city.
'madame duchess maroon outfit and flowy hair is giving michelle obama at the inauguration,' someone else agreed, while someone else added: 'giving me michelle obama at the inauguration vibes!'
a number took to twitter on friday to point out that the duchess of sussex's suit looked a lot like the one worn by obama.

meghan markle, 40, is earning comparisons to michelle obama, 57, after stepping out in a monochromatic suit that looks quite similar to the former first lady's inauguration day outfit
as vogue fashion editor janelle okwodu noted in a recent article about former suits star 'reimagining royal style,' the 'template for dressing post-public life' was set by obama 'in many ways.'

outfit of the day: the duchess of sussex donned a $5,840 loro piana cashmere coat and matching $1,685 wide-leg pants while visiting harlem's ps 123 mahalia jackson school
markle appeared to be channeling obama, 57, in her berry-colored ensemble and twitter users took notice, with one person joking that the royal was 'cosplaying michelle obama on inauguration day.'
spotted: eagle-eyed twitter users noticed her look was similar to the head-to-toe plum suit by sergio hudson that obama wore to president joe biden's inauguration in january
when opening up about her choice, she explained that obama embodies everything she was looking for in an interview subject.
markle certainly admires obama, something she has made clear in the past.
she interviewed the former first lady for british vogue's q&a feature while guest-editing the magazine in 2019.
the choice of color was significant as purple is one of the official colors of the suffragist movement, as was her decision to promote hudson, a young black designer.
'this giving me michelle obama inauguration look,' one person wrote, adding: 'very messy but the outfit looks similar to michelle obama’s inauguration 2021 look.'

the sussexes are in new york for their first official joint engagement since the birth of their daughter lilibet.
the royals are staying at the carlyle hotel on manhattan's upper east side — where top-tier rooms cost up to $8,800 a night.
the designer piece was baggier and far less structured than obama's coat, and markle wore her sleeves cuffed to show the fabric on the other side.
one person joked she was 'cosplaying' obama, while another said the outfit was giving her 'michelle obama at the inauguration vibes'
later she changed into a camel coat by max mara, which she layered over a classic black dress.
markle may very likely be finding inspiration in obama's post-presidency style after she and her husband prince harry confirmed earlier this year that they would not be returning as working members of the royal family following their move to the u.s.
the writer pointed out that the former first lady started dressing for herself after leaving the white house and has been 'embracing her newfound sartorial freedom.'
markle may be experiencing the same thing.
the visit to the school marked the start of the second day of their three-day trip to the big apple, their first major public appearance since quitting the royal family
markle accessorized her designer suit with an estimated $387,000 worth of jewels
the mother-of-two wore a floor-length coat over a form-fitting knit turtleneck and wide-leg pants — all in the same deep berry shade.
she topped off the look with a matching belt featuring a large gold buckle that pulled the outfit together.
the duchess of sussex wore matching heels from manolo blahnik, one of her favorite  brands

 but we’re also building this center because we believe it can speak to some of the central struggles of our time.
we are living through a moment of rapid disruption – in technology and the global economy, in our social arrangements and our environment.
too often, it feels as if our major institutions have failed to respond effectively to these disruptions.
and in the breach, we’ve seen a growing culture of cynicism and mistrust, more division and more bitter conflict.
today we officially broke ground on the obama presidential center on the south side of chicago.
michelle and i couldn't be more excited to officially break ground on the obama presidential center on the south side of chicago.
tune in live:
 the good news is we can reverse these trends, reimagine our institutions, and rebuild our societies in a way that gives more and more people a better life.
 this coming generation of leaders is the source of my hope.
and through this center, we intend to give these young people the training, support, resources and platforms they need to fully realize their enormous potential, collaborate and share ideas, and bring their dreams to scale.
 we will always be grateful for that, and the obama presidential center is our way of repaying some of what this city has given us.
 i believe that because i’ve seen it.
around the world and right here in chicago, there are young people who aren’t waiting for someone else to solve big problems.
instead, in the face of sometimes impossible odds, they are rolling up their sleeves and putting down stakes and making a difference, one neighborhood, one school, one community at a time.
 chicago is where i found my purpose, and where i finally put my ideas about democracy and activism and social change to the test.
most important, it’s where i met a brilliant, beautiful daughter of the south side named michelle robinson.
we were married here, our daughters were born here, and we bought our first home here.
chicago is where almost everything that’s most precious t...o me began.
it’s where i found a home.
 michelle and i can’t imagine a better legacy than that.
for in this next generation of leaders, in chicago and around the world, we see ourselves.
the obama presidential center is our way of showing young people everywhere that they can do the same.

barack obama
<<p>>
after receiving his law degree, obama moved to chicago and became active in the democratic party.
he organized project vote, a drive that registered tens of thousands of african americans on voting rolls and that is credited with helping democrat bill clinton win illinois and capture the presidency in 1992.
the effort also helped make carol moseley braun, an illinois state legislator, the first african american woman elected to the u.s. senate.
during this period, obama wrote his first book and saw it published.
the memoir, dreams from my father (1995), is the story of obama’s search for his biracial identity by tracing the lives of his now-deceased father and his extended family in kenya.
obama lectured on constitutional law at the university of chicago and worked as an attorney on civil rights issues.
obama’s father, barack obama, sr., was a teenage goatherd in rural kenya, won a scholarship to study in the united states, and eventually became a senior economist in the kenyan government.
obama’s mother, s. ann dunham, grew up in kansas, texas, and washington state before her family settled in honolulu.
in 1960 she and barack sr. met in a russian language class at the university of hawaii and married less than a year later.
barack obama’s first book, dreams from my father (1995), is the story of his search for his biracial identity by tracing the lives of his now-deceased father and extended family in kenya.
his second book, the audacity of hope (2006), is a polemic on his vision for the united states.
barack obama was the first african american president of the united states (2009–17).
he oversaw the recovery of the u.s. economy (from the great recession of 2008–09) and the enactment of landmark health care reform (the patient protection and affordable care act).
in 2009 he was awarded the nobel peace prize.
barack obama graduated from punahou school, an elite academy in honolulu, and then attended occidental college before transferring to columbia university and earning (1983) a b.a.
in political science.
he graduated (1991) magna cum laude from harvard university’s law school and was the first african american president of the harvard law review.
when obama was age two, barack sr. left to study at harvard university; shortly thereafter, in 1964, ann and barack sr. divorced.
(obama saw his father only one more time, during a brief visit when obama was 10.)
later ann remarried, this time to another foreign student, lolo soetoro from indonesia, with whom she had a second child, maya.
obama lived for several years in jakarta with his half sister, mother, and stepfather.
while there, obama attended both a government-run school where he received some instruction in islam and a catholic private school where he took part in christian schooling.
obama attended occidental college in suburban los angeles for two years and then transferred to columbia university in new york city, where in 1983 he received a bachelor’s degree in political science.
influenced by professors who pushed him to take his studies more seriously, obama experienced great intellectual growth during college and for a couple of years thereafter.
he led a rather ascetic life and read works of literature and philosophy by william shakespeare, friedrich nietzsche, toni morrison, and others.
after serving for a couple of years as a writer and editor for business international corp., a research, publishing, and consulting firm in manhattan, he took a position in 1985 as a community organizer on chicago’s largely impoverished far south side.
he returned to school three years later and graduated magna cum laude in 1991 from harvard university’s law school, where he was the first african american to serve as president of the harvard law review.
while a summer associate in 1989 at the chicago law firm of sidley austin, obama had met chicago native michelle robinson, a young lawyer at the firm.
the two married in 1992.
after working as a writer and editor in manhattan, barack obama became a community organizer in chicago, lectured on constitutional law at the university of chicago, worked as a civil rights attorney, and then served in the illinois senate (1997–2004), as a u.s. senator (2005–08), and as u.s. president (2009–17).
barack obama’s parents married while students at the university of hawaii.
his father, barack obama, sr., a kenyan, became an economist in the government of kenya.
his mother, s. ann dunham, became an anthropologist.
they divorced in 1964.

barack obama, in full barack hussein obama ii, (born august 4, 1961, honolulu, hawaii, u.s.), 44th president of the united states (2009–17) and the first african american to hold the office.
before winning the presidency, obama represented illinois in the u.s. senate (2005–08).
he was the third african american to be elected to that body since the end of reconstruction (1877).
in 2009 he was awarded the nobel peace prize “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.”

he returned to hawaii in 1971 and lived in a modest apartment, sometimes with his grandparents and sometimes with his mother (she remained for a time in indonesia, returned to hawaii, and then went abroad again—partly to pursue work on a ph.d.—before divorcing soetoro in 1980).
for a brief period his mother was aided by government food stamps, but the family mostly lived a middle-class existence.
in 1979 obama graduated from punahou school, an elite college preparatory academy in honolulu.
