the number of covid-19 patients hospitalised in serious condition has been dropping in recent days, as has the number of confirmed daily cases, which now stand at around 4,000, compared with around 8,000 a month ago.
jerusalem: israel's health ministry has identified fewer than 10 cases of heart inflammation following a third dose of the pfizer-biontech vaccine among millions administered, according to recently released data.
since delta began spreading in june, the government has reimposed indoor mask wearing and israelis require a green pass - a digital document that confirms full immunisation, including a third shot, or recovery from the illness - to enter most places of leisure.

in data published late on thursday (sep 30), the health ministry reported nine cases of myocarditis within four age groups that comprised more than 1.5 million people who had received a booster shot.

israel began administering boosters to risk groups in july and by the end of august expanded its campaign to include anyone above the age of 12, five months or more after a second dose.
in total, out of all 3.2 million israelis who have received a third jab, 25 reported serious adverse events that appeared within 30 days of the shot, including myocarditis, though a causal link had yet to be established among many of them.
employing a "living with covid" strategy, the government is hoping that the boosters, so far administered to around a third of the 9.3 million population, will fend off an outbreak of the delta variant while the economy is kept open.
teachers must either be vaccinated or get tested in order to enter schools.
but experts are concerned that, with schools reopening this week after the jewish high holiday season, illness will shoot up again.
they have urged the government to take more steps to rein in infections, such as limiting large crowds, and not to rely on boosters alone.
all were male, three were between the ages of 16 and 29 and six were in the 30 to 59 group.
eight more possible cases were still being reviewed.
most myocarditis cases are generally mild, the ministry said.
having kicked off its rapid vaccination drive relatively early, in december, israel was one of the first countries to report that the vaccine's protection diminished with time, and has since deemed its booster campaign safe and effective.

the booster drive is being watched closely in the united states, where third pfizer shots have been rolled out for those 65 and older, all people at high risk of severe disease, and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.

kids may not be able to get pfizer shots until november; vaccination rates among pregnant people low: today's covid-19 updates
<<p>>
the international olympic committee has released a first glimpse of the covid-19 protocols that will be in place at the upcoming 2022 winter games in beijing – including lengthy quarantines for unvaccinated participants, daily covid-19 testing and the absence of international spectators.
unlike in tokyo, where athletes mostly competed behind closed doors, beijing 2022 organizers said some chinese fans will be permitted to attend their games, as long as they follow to-be-determined protocols.

"specifically, content that falsely alleges that approved vaccines are dangerous and cause chronic health effects, claims that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease or contains misinformation on the substances contained in vaccines will be removed," the company said in a blog post.
the false claims that vaccines are tied to autism or infertility or that vaccines contain some sort of tracking material are also included in this crackdown, the company said.
vaccination rates among people who are pregnant have been low, despite evidence that vaccines can prevent the "severe risk of severe disease" posed to pregnant people from covid-19.
only 18% of pregnant people have received a dose, according to the centers for disease control and prevention data.
women giving birth while having covid-19 had “significantly higher rates” of icu admission, intubation, ventilation and death, according to a study published in the journal of the american medical association.
in august alone, 21 pregnant people died of covid-19, according to the cdc.
that may mean authorization could be delayed until november, the journal reported.
reuters reported it could come as early as the end of october.
► the world health organization said global covid-19 cases and deaths dropped by about 10% in the past week, continuing an ongoing decline for the past several weeks.

about 35,600 workers were still poised to leave jobs at hospitals, nursing homes and adult care facilities to avoid getting vaccinated.
unvaccinated players will be subject regular testing, they won't be allowed to eat indoors in the same room as their vaccinated teammates, and their lockers will be "as distant from other players as possible and not next to another non-fully-vaccinated player."

moderna vs. pfizer: both knockouts, but one seems to have the edge
<<p>>
there is limited evidence showing the effect of that dose, and none on how long the higher antibody levels might last.
federal regulators are reviewing moderna’s data to determine whether the available data are sufficient to authorize a booster shot of the half dose.
the two vaccines have diverged more sharply in their efficacy against infection.
protection from both waned over time, particularly after the arrival of the delta variant, but the pfizer-biontech vaccine’s values fell lower.
in two of the recent studies, the moderna vaccine did better at preventing illness by more than 30 percentage points.
it was a constant refrain from federal health officials after the coronavirus vaccines were authorized: these shots are all equally effective.
roughly 221 million doses of the pfizer-biontech vaccine have been dispensed thus far in the united states, compared with about 150 million doses of moderna’s vaccine.
in a half-dozen studies published over the past few weeks, moderna’s vaccine appeared to be more protective than the pfizer-biontech vaccine in the months after immunization.
by apoorva mandavilli
the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines rely on the same mrna platform, and in the initial clinical trials, they had remarkably similar efficacy against symptomatic infection: 95 percent for pfizer-biontech and 94 percent for moderna.
this was in part why they were described as more or less equivalent.
even in the original clinical trials of the three vaccines eventually authorized in the united states — made by pfizer-biontech, moderna and johnson & johnson — it was clear that the j.&j.
vaccine had a lower efficacy than the other two.
research since then has borne out that trend, although j.&j.
announced this week that a second dose of its vaccine boosts its efficacy to levels comparable to the others.
“at the end of the day, i do think there are subtle but real differences between moderna and pfizer,” dr. jeffrey wilson, an immunologist and physician at the university of virginia in charlottesville who was a co-author of one such study, published in jama network open this month.
“in high-risk populations, it might be relevant.
it’d be good if people took a close look.”

vaccine manufacturers would typically have enough time to test a range of doses before choosing one — and they have done such testing for their trials of the coronavirus vaccine in children.
supported by
but the discrepancy is small and the real-world consequences uncertain, because both vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, she and others cautioned.
scientists who were initially skeptical of the reported differences between the moderna and pfizer-biontech vaccines have slowly become convinced that the disparity is small but real.
the extra week may give immune cells more time to proliferate before the second dose, said dr. paul burton, moderna’s chief medical officer.
“we need to keep studying this and to do more research, but i think it’s plausible.”
moderna’s efficacy against severe illness in those studies ranged from 92 to 100 percent.
pfizer-biontech’s numbers trailed by 10 to 15 percentage points.
scientists had initially hoped that the vaccines would have an efficacy of 50 or 60 percent.
“we would have all seen that as great result and been happy with it,” he said.
“fast forward to now, and we’re debating whether 96.3 percent vaccine efficacy for moderna versus 88.8 percent for pfizer is a big deal.”
several factors might underlie the divergence.
the vaccines differ in their dosing and in the time between the first and second doses.
but in the midst of a pandemic last year, the companies had to guess at the optimal dose.
pfizer went with 30 micrograms, moderna with 100.
“it’s not appropriate for people who took pfizer to be freaking out that they got an inferior vaccine.”
for example, the pfizer-biontech vaccine was rolled out weeks before moderna’s to priority groups — older adults and health care workers.
immunity wanes more quickly in older adults, so a decline observed in a group consisting mostly of older adults may give the false impression that the protection from the pfizer-biontech vaccine falls off quickly.
a series of studies found that the moderna vaccine seemed to be more protective as the months passed than the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
here’s why.
“yes, likely a real difference, probably reflecting what’s in the two vials,” said john moore, a virologist at weill cornell medicine in new york.
“but truly, how much does this difference matter in the real world?”
the subtleties emerged over time.
the vaccines have never been directly compared in a carefully designed study, so the data indicating that effects vary are based mostly on observations.
moderna’s vaccine relies on a lipid nanoparticle that can deliver the larger dose.
and the first and second shots of that vaccine are staggered by four weeks, compared with three for the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
“our baseline assumption is that the mrna vaccines are functioning similarly, but then you start to see a separation,” said natalie dean, a biostatistician at emory university in atlanta.
“it’s not a huge difference, but at least it’s consistent.”
results from those studies can be skewed by any number of factors, including the location, the age of the population vaccinated, when they were immunized and the timing between the doses, dr. dean said.
if the efficacy gap continues to widen, it may have implications for the debate on booster shots.
federal agencies this week are evaluating the need for a third shot of the pfizer-biontech vaccine for some high-risk groups, including older adults.
“pfizer is a big hammer,” dr. wilson added, but “moderna is a sledgehammer.”
but by now, the observational studies have delivered results from a number of locations — qatar, the mayo clinic in minnesota, several other states in the united states — and in health care workers, hospitalized veterans or the general population.
moderna’s team recently showed that a half dose of the vaccine still sent antibody levels soaring.
based on those data, the company asked the f.d.a.
this month to authorize 50 micrograms, the half dose, as a booster shot.
given those caveats, “i’m not convinced that there truly is a difference,” said dr. bill gruber, a senior vice president at pfizer.
“i don’t think there’s sufficient data out there to make that claim.”
that has turned out not to be true.
research published on friday by the centers for disease control and prevention found that the efficacy of the pfizer-biontech vaccine against hospitalization fell from 91 percent to 77 percent after a four-month period following the second shot.
the moderna vaccine showed no decline over the same period.
the latest such study, published on wednesday in the new england journal of medicine, evaluated the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness in about 5,000 health care workers in 25 states.
the study found that the pfizer-biontech vaccine had an effectiveness of 88.8 percent, compared with moderna’s 96.3 percent.
still, other experts said that the corpus of evidence pointed to a disparity that would be worth exploring, at least in people who respond weakly to vaccines, including older adults and immunocompromised people.
a few studies found that the levels of antibodies produced by the pfizer-biontech vaccine were one-third to one-half those produced by the moderna vaccine.
yet that decrease is trivial, dr. moore said: for comparison, there is a more than 100-fold difference in the antibody levels among healthy individuals.
ultimately, both vaccines are still holding steady against severe illness and hospitalization, especially in people under 65, dr. moore said.

boys more at risk from pfizer jab side-effect than covid, suggests study
<<p>>
last modified on sun 12 sep 2021 18.14 bst
most children who experienced the rare side-effect had symptoms within days of the second shot of pfizer/biontech vaccine, though a similar side-effect is seen with the moderna jab.
about 86% of the boys affected required some hospital care, the authors said.
 this article was amended on 12 september 2021 to add feedback from the mhra
so far, uk children have not been admitted to hospital for covid in large numbers and may not be at great risk of long covid.
while the recent clock study found that up to 14% of children who caught covid may still have symptoms 15 weeks later, levels of fatigue appear similar to those in children who have not caught the virus.
this suggests that children may be spared some of the most debilitating problems seen in adult long covid.
saul faust, professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at the university of southampton, who was not involved in the work, said the findings appeared to justify the cautious approach taken on teenage vaccines by the uk’s joint committee on vaccines and immunisation.
the mhra said it has been closely monitoring all available data on the potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following covid-19 vaccination.
“we have concluded that the covid-19 vaccines made by pfizer/biontech and moderna may be linked with a small increase in the risk of these very rare conditions.
the cases tended to be mild and the vast majority recovered with simple treatment and rest,” they added.
us researchers say teenagers are more likely to get vaccine-related myocarditis than end up in hospital with covid
“safety monitoring strategies are in place for individuals under 18 years, including monitoring myocarditis and pericarditis occurring post-vaccination and the long term outcomes with these events.
the mhra continues to keep the safety of covid-19 vaccines under close and continual review,” the spokesperson added.
healthy boys may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with a rare side-effect of the pfizer/biontech covid vaccine that causes inflammation of the heart than with covid itself, us researchers claim.
the jcvi did not recommend vaccinating healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, but referred the matter to the uk’s chief medical officers who are expected to make a final decision next week.
children aged 12 to 15 who are particularly vulnerable to covid, or who live with an at-risk person, are eligible for the shots.
“while myocarditis after vaccination is exceptionally rare, we may be able to change the first or second doses or combine vaccines differently to avoid the risk at all, once we understand the physiology better,” said prof faust.
“on balance, there is no urgency to immunise children from a medical perspective, although if schools are unable to maintain education for the vast majority at all times, the overall balance could shift.
if my two teenage children are offered the vaccine by the nhs my gp wife and i will have no hesitation in allowing them to receive the vaccine.”
how reliable the data is and whether similar numbers could be seen in the uk if healthy 12 to 15-year-olds are vaccinated are unclear: vaccine reactions are recorded differently in the us and shots are given at longer time intervals in the uk.
according to the uk medicines regulator, the rate of myocarditis after covid vaccination is only six per million shots of pfizer/biontech.
prof adam finn, a member of jcvi at the university of bristol, said: “i stand by the jcvi advice, which is not to go ahead at this time with vaccinating healthy 12 to 15-year-olds on health outcome risk-benefit grounds given the current uncertainty – as there is a small but plausible risk that rare harms could turn out to outweigh modest benefits.”
their analysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with covid over a four-month period.
in the latest study, which has yet to be peer reviewed, dr tracy høeg at the university of california and colleagues analysed adverse reactions to covid vaccines in us children aged 12 to 17 during the first six months of 2021.
they estimate the rate of myocarditis after two shots of pfizer/biontech vaccine to be 162.2 cases per million for healthy boys aged 12 to 15 and 94 cases per million for healthy boys aged 16 to 17.
the equivalent rates for girls were 13.4 and 13 cases per million, respectively.
at current us infection rates, the risk of a healthy adolescent being taken to hospital with covid in the next 120 days is about 44 per million, they said.
the spokesperson said the latest study had been considered by the government’s independent advisory body, the covid-19 vaccines benefit risk expert working group, which found that the interpretation of the findings was limited by the fact that the study did not take into account differences in treatment practices when comparing hospitalisation rates between covid-19 infections and myocarditis and pericarditis presenting post-vaccination, and there was no assessment of severity and duration of illness after admission.
the overwhelming majority of myocarditis appears after the second dose of vaccine, so offering single shots could protect children while reducing their risk of the side effect even further.

 pfizer’s investigational rsv vaccine candidate builds on foundational basic science discoveries including those made at the national institutes of health (nih), which detailed the crystal structure of a key form of a viral protein that rsv uses to attack human cells.
the nih research showed that the antibodies that protect humans from rsv target this one form of the viral protein.
applying insights from this important work, pfizer developed and tested numerous candidates and identified those that elicited a strong anti-viral immune response in pre-clinical evaluation, which led to the vaccine candidate that pfizer is evaluating in human trials.

about rsvpref
the information contained in this release is as of september 2, 2021.
pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward‐looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments.
 in july 2021, pfizer provided an update on a phase 2a study evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of rsvpref in a virus challenge model in healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age.
the results of the study enabled pfizer to proceed to phase 3.
detailed results from the phase 2a study will be shared in a future scientific forum.
this release contains forward-looking information about pfizer’s respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) bivalent prefusion f subunit vaccine (rsvpref) candidate, including its potential benefits, that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable new clinical data and further analyses of existing clinical data; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments by regulatory authorities; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from our clinical studies; whether and when biologic license applications may be filed in any jurisdictions for rsvpref for any potential indications; whether and when any such applications may be approved by regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the product's benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the product's efficacy and, if approved, whether rsvpref will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of rsvpref; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities regarding rsvpref and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; the impact of covid-19 on our business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.
 the risk of serious infection increases in older adults and for those with chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system.2 in the u.s., it is estimated that more than 177,000 older adults ≥65 years of age are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die each year due to rsv.
2,6 there is no vaccine to prevent rsv and the medical community is limited to offering only supportive care for those with the illness.
 at pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.
we strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of health care products, including innovative medicines and vaccines.

 rsv is a seasonal illness that commonly starts in the fall months, peaking in the winter when colds and other respiratory illnesses are more common.1
 “rsv is a significant cause of severe respiratory disease in older adults, and it can cause disability and death.
there is an important unmet medical need for an effective vaccine that can help protect older adults against this highly-contagious disease,” said kathrin u. jansen, ph.d., senior vice president and head of vaccine research & development at pfizer inc. “the start of this phase 3 study is an important step forward towards our goal of comprehensive immunization against rsv disease, which includes developing a potential first vaccine to help prevent rsv disease in adults as well as the ongoing efforts to help protect infants through maternal immunization, subject to regulatory approval of the candidate vaccine.”
source: pfizer inc.
 the phase 3 renoir trial of rsvpref is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that expects to enroll approximately 30,000 participants 60 years and older.
the primary objectives of the study will assess safety and efficacy for the prevention of moderate to severe lower respiratory tract illness (mslrti-rsv) during the first rsv season.
 respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a common and pervasive cause of acute respiratory illness.2,3 the virus is highly contagious and affects the lungs and airways.
4,5 infections occur in people of all ages and can feel like the common cold for most young adults, but for infants, the immunocompromised, and older adults, it can be potentially life-threatening.3

the most frequent underlying medical conditions among clinical trial participants were obesity (35%), diabetes (8%), and pulmonary disease (8%).
cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults have been reported more often after getting the second dose than after the first dose of one of the two mrna covid-19 vaccines, pfizer-biontech or moderna.
these reports are rare and the known and potential benefits of covid-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis.
