<<h1>>
sir stamford raffles
<<p>>
raffles inaugurated a mass of reforms aimed at transforming the dutch colonial system and improving the condition of the native population.
his reforms, however, proved too costly to a trading company primarily concerned with profit and were short-lived.
after four and a half years in java, suffering from increasing ill health and shattered by the death of his wife, he was recalled.
left vulnerable to personal attack by the death of minto, he sailed for england on march 25, 1816, thoroughly out of favour with the court of directors of the east india company.
entrusted with an independent authority that aroused jealousy in penang, raffles established his headquarters in malacca.
rewarded for his extraordinary work by an appointment to minto’s staff, raffles sailed with him to java, where the expeditionary force landed without mishap on aug. 6, 1811, and, after a short and sharp engagement with the dutch-french forces, occupied the island.
minto gave considerable credit for the success to raffles.
having already described him as “a very clever, able, active and judicious man,” he now recognized his intellectual and administrative ability and his humanism and concern for the javanese, and on september 11 he proclaimed him lieutenant governor of java.
shortly afterward minto sailed for calcutta, leaving raffles at the age of 30 to rule not only java but also an archipelagic empire of several million inhabitants.
the port of singapore is a free port, and the trade thereof is open to ships and vessels of every nation .
.
.
equally and alike to all.
born to an improvident merchant captain and his wife during a homeward voyage from the west indies, raffles grew up in an atmosphere of debt.
forced to cut short his schooling at the age of 14, he entered the service of the east india company as a clerk in order to support his mother and four sisters.
although his formal education was inadequate, he studied the sciences and several languages at his own leisure and conceived an interest in natural history that was to earn him a distinguished reputation.
his industry won him such notice that at the age of 23 he was appointed assistant secretary to the newly formed government of penang, a hitherto inconspicuous island at the northern entrance to the strait of malacca.
by a treaty of march 17, 1824, the dutch relinquished all claim to singapore.
for raffles, however, this was a time of rapidly deteriorating health, characterized by headaches of increasing ferocity, and he sailed for england, arriving there on aug. 22, 1824.
in london his vast collections illustrating natural history and malayan lore won him acclaim as an orientalist, and he assisted in founding the london zoo, of which he was elected the first president.
he died of a brain tumour in july 1826.
in penang, which had been established to give britain a foothold in the dutch-held east indies, raffles shaped his career by an intensive exploration into the language, history, and culture of the malayan peoples scattered over the islands of the archipelago.
this unique study caught the attention of lord minto, governor-general of india, at a time of crisis, when napoleon was using java as a springboard for the destruction of britain’s slow and lumbering ships, the indiamen, on the long haul to china.
determined to remove java from french influence, minto appointed raffles his agent to prepare the way for a naval invasion.
he never regained their full confidence.
despite a dazzling london success in both fashionable and learned society that culminated in his election as a fellow of the royal society and the award of knighthood, he resumed his eastern service in a situation of reduced and restricted authority, as lieutenant governor of the dilapidated, fever-ridden pepper port of bengkulu on the west coast of sumatra.
yet it was from bengkulu, as he watched the dutch regain possession of the indonesian archipelago and enforce a policy of complete commercial monopoly, that he made his next move to extend british influence in southeastern asia.
our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.
in a voyage to calcutta, which all but ended in shipwreck, he employed his wide knowledge of eastern affairs and his powers of persuasion to convince lord hastings, then governor-general of india, that immediate and forceful action was essential to safeguard british trade with the far east.
on dec. 7, 1818, he sailed from calcutta, bearing hastings’ qualified authority to establish a fortified post eastward of the straits of malacca and so placed as to wedge open the gateway to the china seas.
on the morning of jan. 29, 1819, he landed on the shore of a sparsely populated island off the southern tip of malaya and, risking imminent collision with the dutch, established by treaty the port of singapore.
although he returned to his post at bengkulu for three years, he went back to singapore in october 1822, when he reorganized the various branches of the administration.
his regulations of january 1823 stated,
sir stamford raffles, in full sir thomas stamford raffles, (born july 6, 1781, at sea, off port morant, jam.—died july 5, 1826, london, eng.
), british east indian administrator and founder of the port city of singapore (1819), who was largely responsible for the creation of britain’s far eastern empire.
he was knighted in 1816.
