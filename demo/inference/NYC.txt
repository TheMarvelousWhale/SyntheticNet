federal judge deals blow to covid-19 vaccine mandate for nyc teachers
<<p>>
“we’re confident our vaccine mandate will continue to be upheld once all the facts have been presented, because that is the level of protection our students and staff deserve,” filson said in an email.

new york city schools have been temporarily blocked from enforcing a vaccine mandate for its teachers and other workers by a federal appeals judge just days before it was to take effect.
featured
mayor bill de blasio announced in august that about 148,000 school employees would have to get at least a first dose of the covid-19 vaccination by sept. 27.
the policy covers teachers, along with other staffers, such as custodians and cafeteria workers.
it's the first no-test-option vaccination mandate for a broad group of city workers in the nation’s most populous city.
and it mirrors a similar statewide mandate for hospital and nursing home workers set to go into effect monday.
even though most school workers have been vaccinated, unions representing new york city principals and teachers warned that could still leave the 1 million-student school system short of as many as 10,000 teachers, along with other staffers.
tv
department of education spokesperson danielle filson said that officials are seeking a speedy resolution and that the circuit court has the motion on its calendar for wednesday.
as of friday, 82 percent of department employees have been vaccinated, including 88 percent of teachers.
“we’ve been planning all along.
we have a lot of substitutes ready,” the democrat said in a radio interview on friday.
“a lot is going to happen between now and monday but beyond that, we are ready, even to the tune of, if we need thousands, we have thousands.”
 follow nbc news
workers in the nation’s largest school system were to be required to show vaccination proof starting monday.
but late friday, a judge for the 2nd u.s.
circuit court of appeals granted a temporary injunction sought by a group of teachers and referred the case to a three-judge panel an an expedited basis.
the new york post reported that the department sent an email to principals saturday morning saying they “should continue to prepare for the possibility that the vaccine mandate will go into effect later in the week.”
de blasio has resisted calls to delay the mandate, insisting the city was ready.

the prime minister waved before being ushered by his security detail toward the hotel.
indeed, bennett was expected to remain at his hotel on tuesday before flying home at night.
israelis celebrate the simchat torah holiday a day before jews in the diaspora, so none of manhattan’s many synagogues would be offering the applicable services for the israeli prime minister.
in one of his favorite stories to share in front of an american jewish audience, bennett tells how he and his wife gilat were out for a walk one sabbath afternoon on the upper east side when they passed a kj sign for “beginner’s minyan.”
 we’re really pleased that you’ve read x times of israel articles in the past month.

but the premier had actually walked some 25 blocks down 5th avenue, snatching a peek of central park as baffled new yorkers looked on, wondering about the identity of the vip who required a motorcade dozens of vehicles-long that wasn’t even being used.
new york — slotted to address the united nations just hours before the start of the shemini atzeret festival on monday evening, israel’s first-ever observant prime minister naftali bennett was forced to remain stateside an extra day, for the second time in a month, in order to avoid violating traditional observance of the holiday.
“it was a very warm speech during which he also talked about the bonds that unite jews both here and in israel,” another participant said.
“it was a very homey, feel-good dvar, but light on the issues.”
entrance to the synagogue was limited to select members along with bennett and his staff.
while their religious colleagues had taken the night off to pray at other shuls, some of the non-observant members of the traveling press staked out on the corner of park avenue and 85th st, hoping to snap footage of the prime minister making his way back to the hotel from the synagogue.
so now we have a request.
unlike other news outlets, we haven’t put up a paywall.
but as the journalism we do is costly, we invite readers for whom the times of israel has become important to help support our work by joining the times of israel community.

it would be a unique sight as bennett was going to walk the 1⅓ miles back to the loews regency hotel in midtown, rather than taking the motorcade that brought him to kj before the holiday had begun.

“i’m using it.

“we won’t have anything to report tomorrow anyways.”
“if there’s one thing i want to import from american jewry to israel, it’s the ability to listen, the ability to not put people in a box,” he said.
“here, you’re just a jew, and you’re welcome.”

bennett later gave remarks after themaariv service, stretching out a 15-minute time slot to fondly recall his history with the synagogue that began on a whim.
some had hoped bennett would have used the monday eve opportunity to visit a conservative or reform synagogue, in a gesture to the majority of us jewry who are not orthodox.
after the kehilath jeshurun services drew to a close, members began trickling out of the synagogue and the motorcade slowly rolled away down park avenue.
kehilath jeshurun (kj) welcomed back bennett and his entourage, with its senior rabbi chaim steinmetz introducing the premier to the packed crowd of nearly 200 people before services began.
“the prime minister said [in his remarks] that it was here, not in israel, where his secular wife established a connection to judaism,” said one worshiper who was in attendance on monday.
but the premier used the opportunity to return to the modern orthodox synagogue that he and his wife frequented some 20 years ago when they lived in manhattan as he launched his tech start-up.
but the premier did make a point of recognizing the strength in american jewry’s pluralism during an address to jewish federation leaders earlier in the day.
“shabbat shalom, mr. prime minister,” one of the secular reporters shouted at the premier, confusing shemini atzeret with the sabbath.
the circumstances monday were far more festive than those that prompted bennett’s last extended stay in the us in late august.
then, a suicide bombing at kabul’s international airport killing 13 us soldiers and some 170 of the civilians they were helping evacuate out of taliban-ridden afghanistan, led us president joe biden to push his oval office meeting with the israeli prime minister from thursday to friday.
unable to leave the hotel due to the health ministry’s strict coronavirus guidelines at the top, bennett participated in friday night services and dinner in the ballroom of dc’s willard intercontinental.
this time though, the extra day in the us was planned in advance, and he was able to celebrate shemini atzeret with the same rabbi that welcomed him and his wife two decades earlier — haskel lookstein, who was in attendance on monday evening in his capacity as kj’s rabbi emeritus.
the press finally caught up to bennett as he turned onto 61st, capturing the unique moment on their phones as nypd officers shouted at them to remain on the sidewalk.

the traveling press then debated among themselves as to whether the odd scene they had just documented was newsworthy enough to make it into the next day’s broadcasts.

as they waited for bennett to re-appear, longtime photographer shahar azran kept the press entertained, sharing photos and stories of the various prime ministers he has covered on trips to the united states.
the one that roused the most laughs concerned ariel sharon, who found himself chatting with michael jackson at a dinner party for ten minutes before turning to an aide and asking who the young man was.
convinced though that the convoy was a decoy designed to lure them away from the prime minister, the half a dozen israeli reporters hurried down lexington avenue, expecting to catch an unsuspecting bennett there.

 		man walking on nyc street attacked by rooster that has terrorized neighbors for years
<<p>>
"it's a big rooster.
it's not one you want to eat, doesn't look like one you'd want to eat," a neighbor said.
"the fact that now it's attacking people."
"they roam the streets, and residents need to be on the lookout," said suseran, who got a tetanus shot and is on antibiotics.
"my neighbor got attacked in june, bit her ankle," said suseran.
another neighbor said that the clucky crew roams around and has chased kids, and parents avoid the area with their children.
those who live in the area said that the rooster and a group of chickens have been roaming the area around 169th street in jamaica for years, terrorizing people.
neighbors say they are now more vigilant, watching their back for the marauding rooster.
his aggressor was a rooster.
a man who answered the door at the home where neighbors said the rooster and chickens are kept appeared to claim ownership of the birds.
but he was quickly prevented from answering more questions by someone else in the home.
"just usually walking to head to my bus to go to work, and i felt a peck on my left hand," said leon suseran.
"this thing kept coming, so vicious, almost evil ... blood was gushing, and i was trying to apply pressure to it and it kept charging at me."
suseran's feathered foe isn't just any ordinary rooster.
it has a reputation in the neighborhood.
while hens are legally allowed to be kept in the city, roosters are not.
the city's department of health wasn't available to respond on thursday, but suseran said he filed a complaint with them already.
a man in queens is crying fowl after an animal attack on his way to work left him bloodied and concerned for his neighbors' safety — but it wasn't a dog, cat or even a new york city rat that went after him.
"i've heard kids can't ride scooters, you can't walk freely.
you've got to be careful now of a rooster," the neighbor said with a laugh.
it's hard not to chuckle at the idea that people now have to keep an eye out for an attacking rooster on new york city streets.
but anyone who lives in the area says it's no joke.
police helped corral the rooster and a chicken after suseran's violent run-in thursday left him bleeding badly from a gash on his hand.
